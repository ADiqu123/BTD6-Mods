The tower idea and art comes from https://www.reddit.com/r/btd6/comments/mxjj42/tower_idea_zap_monkey/.
You need BTD6 Mod Helper to use this mod. You can download it here: https://github.com/gurrenm3/BTD-Mod-Helper/releases. (BTD6 Mod Helper was not made by me.)
To use the mod download ZapMonkey.dll and put ZapMonkey.dll in your BTD6 Mods folder. Also put BTD6 Mod Helper in your Mods Folder and thats all you need to use this mod.
